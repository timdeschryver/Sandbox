# Sandbox Application - Comprehensive E2E Test Plan

## Application Overview

The Sandbox application is an Angular-based customer management system with a .NET backend using the BFF (Backend for Frontend) pattern with Keycloak authentication. The application features:

- **Authentication**: OpenID Connect flow via Keycloak with session-based authentication (HTTP-only cookies)
- **Customer Management**: CRUD operations for customers with support for billing and shipping addresses
- **API Gateway**: YARP-based gateway handling authentication and request proxying
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with Signal Forms and server-side validation
- **Navigation**: Angular routing with authenticated and anonymous states
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and retry mechanisms

### Key Features

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Login via `/bff/login` redirects to Keycloak
   - Session stored server-side with HTTP-only cookies
   - Logout clears both application and OIDC sessions
   - User information displayed in header

2. **Customer Management**
   - List all customers in a table
   - Create customers with optional billing and shipping addresses
   - View detailed customer information
   - Delete customers (soft delete)
   - Random delay simulation (10-2000ms) on customer creation

3. **Form Validation Rules**
   - First Name: Required
   - Last Name: Required
   - Billing Address: Optional, when enabled all fields required
     - Street: Required, min 3 characters
     - City: Required, min 3 characters
     - Zip Code: Required, 3-5 characters
   - Shipping Address: Optional, when enabled all fields required
     - Street: Required, min 3 characters
     - City: Required, min 3 characters
     - Zip Code: Required, 3-5 characters
     - Note: Optional, but if provided must be min 10 characters

## Test Execution Strategy

### Priority Levels

**P0 - Critical (Must Pass)**

- 1.1 User Login Flow
- 2.1 Create Customer - Minimal Information Only
- 2.5 Create Customer - With Both Addresses
- 3.1 Submit Empty Form
- 4.1 View Customer Details - Minimal Customer

**P1 - High Priority**

- 1.3 User Logout Flow
- 2.2 Create Customer - With Billing Address
- 2.3 Create Customer - With Shipping Address
- 3.4 Billing Address - Incomplete Information
- 4.5 Navigate Back to Overview

**P2 - Medium Priority**

- All remaining validation scenarios (3.x series)
- Error handling scenarios (6.x series)
- Accessibility scenarios (7.x series)

**P3 - Low Priority**

- Edge cases and security scenarios
- Cross-browser specific tests
- Data persistence verification

### Test Data Management

- Use random string generation (`generateRandomString()`) for names to avoid conflicts
- Each test should be independent and not rely on data from other tests
- Clean up test data after test runs where possible (delete customers)
- Use meaningful test data that's easy to identify in failures

### Execution Environment

- **Local Development**: Run tests against local Aspire environment
- **CI/CD**: Run tests with `--workers=1` to prevent concurrency issues
- **Retry Strategy**: 2 retries on CI, 0 retries on local
- **Browser Coverage**: Chromium and Firefox (as configured)

### Known Limitations

- Random delay (10-2000ms) on customer creation may cause timing issues
- Session expiry testing may require manual intervention
- Server error simulation requires infrastructure changes
- Concurrent creation tests may be flaky due to timing

## Success Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: All user-facing features covered by at least one test
- **Pass Rate**: 95%+ pass rate in CI environment
- **Execution Time**: Full suite completes in under 10 minutes
- **Reliability**: No more than 1-2% flaky tests
- **Maintainability**: Tests use Page Object Model or similar pattern

## Recommended Test Additions

Based on this plan, consider implementing:

1. **Page Objects**: Create reusable page objects for CustomerList, CustomerForm, CustomerDetails
2. **Custom Fixtures**: Create fixtures for "authenticated user with N customers"
3. **Test Helpers**: Extract common operations (createCustomer, deleteCustomer) into helpers
4. **Visual Regression**: Add screenshot comparison tests for key pages
5. **Performance Tests**: Add tests measuring page load times and API response times
6. **API Tests**: Add direct API testing for edge cases not easily testable via UI

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize test scenarios with team
2. Implement P0 critical tests first
3. Set up test infrastructure (Page Objects, fixtures, helpers)
4. Implement P1 and P2 tests incrementally
5. Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
6. Monitor test stability and adjust retry/timeout strategies
7. Review and update test plan quarterly
